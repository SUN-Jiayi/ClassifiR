Description: This package provides a comparison of multiple binary classification models with performance-based selection, and supports automated hyperparameter tuning within user-defined ranges. It includes preprocessing, modelling (KNN, logistic, SVM, decision treeï¼Œrandom forests, boosting), and evaluation functions (e.g., confusion matrix, ROC, AUC) along with visualization tools.
