\title{Predict One Sample Using the Decision Tree}
\usage{
predict_tree(tree, x)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{A trained decision tree (nested list structure returned by \code{build_tree}).}

\item{x}{A named vector or list representing one sample (must contain all required feature names).}
}
\value{
Predicted class label: 0 or 1.
}
\description{
Predicts the class label (0 or 1) for a single observation using a trained decision tree model.
The input sample must be provided as a named vector or list, with names matching the feature names used in training.

The function recursively traverses the tree until it reaches a leaf node and returns the class prediction stored there.
}
\examples{
# Create toy data
X = data.frame(
  x1 = c(2, 5, 4, 3, 7, 2),
  x2 = c(1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2)
)
y = c(0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0)

# Train a decision tree
tree = build_tree(X, y, max_depth = 2, min_samples_split = 2)

# Predict a new sample
sample = as.list(X[1, ])
pred = predict_tree(tree, sample)
print(pred)
