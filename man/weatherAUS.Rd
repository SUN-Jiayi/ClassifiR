\title{Weather Observations Dataset for Predicting Rainfall in Australia}
\format{
A data frame with 142,193 rows and 24 columns:
\describe{
  \item{Date}{Character. The date of the observation in YYYY-MM-DD format. Useful for time-based feature extraction or chronological splits.}
  \item{Location}{Factor. The name of the weather station (e.g., Albury, Cairns). Represents the geographical location of the observation.}
  \item{MinTemp}{Numeric. Minimum temperature (°C) recorded that day. Can be used to assess the overnight cooling.}
  \item{MaxTemp}{Numeric. Maximum temperature (°C) recorded that day. Typically reached in the afternoon.}
  \item{Rainfall}{Numeric. Amount of rainfall (mm) recorded over the 24-hour period to 9am. A value of 0 indicates no rain.}
  \item{Evaporation}{Numeric. Pan evaporation (mm) over 24 hours. Available only at selected locations. Indicates water loss due to evaporation.}
  \item{Sunshine}{Numeric. Number of hours of bright sunshine in the day. Often correlates negatively with rainfall.}
  \item{WindGustDir}{Factor. Cardinal direction (e.g., N, NW, SE) of the strongest wind gust during the day.}
  \item{WindGustSpeed}{Numeric. Speed (km/h) of the strongest wind gust observed in the day.}
  \item{WindDir9am}{Factor. Wind direction at 9am local time.}
  \item{WindDir3pm}{Factor. Wind direction at 3pm local time.}
  \item{WindSpeed9am}{Numeric. Wind speed (km/h) at 9am.}
  \item{WindSpeed3pm}{Numeric. Wind speed (km/h) at 3pm.}
  \item{Humidity9am}{Numeric. Relative humidity (\%) at 9am. High humidity may indicate potential for rain.}
  \item{Humidity3pm}{Numeric. Relative humidity (\%) at 3pm. Often used for forecasting afternoon storms.}
  \item{Pressure9am}{Numeric. Atmospheric pressure (hPa) at 9am. Low pressure often precedes rainy conditions.}
  \item{Pressure3pm}{Numeric. Atmospheric pressure (hPa) at 3pm.}
  \item{Cloud9am}{Numeric (0–8). Fraction of the sky covered by cloud at 9am, where 0 = clear and 8 = fully overcast.}
  \item{Cloud3pm}{Numeric (0–8). Cloud cover at 3pm. Missing in many locations.}
  \item{Temp9am}{Numeric. Temperature (°C) recorded at 9am. Often used in combination with humidity and pressure to forecast weather.}
  \item{Temp3pm}{Numeric. Temperature (°C) at 3pm.}
  \item{RainToday}{Factor. Whether it rained today ("Yes" or "No"), based on whether at least 1mm of rain was recorded. This is a useful predictor for RainTomorrow.}
  \item{RainTomorrow}{Factor. \strong{Target variable} — "Yes" if 1mm or more of rain is expected the next day, "No" otherwise. This is the binary label used for classification.}

\description{
This dataset provides daily weather records collected from various stations across Australia and is designed
for binary classification tasks — specifically, predicting whether it will rain the next day (`RainTomorrow`).
}
\details{
It contains 142,193 entries with 24 variables, including a mix of numerical and categorical features that
capture key meteorological conditions such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall.

The target variable, `RainTomorrow`, is a binary indicator with values "Yes" or "No".
Since several predictors contain missing values, this dataset is also well-suited for exploring
preprocessing techniques such as missing data imputation or feature engineering.


- Time span: The dataset includes observations from 2008 to 2017. \cr
- Locations: Covers multiple cities and regions across Australia. \cr
- Missing values: Several columns have missing entries, particularly Evaporation, Sunshine, and cloud-related features. \cr
- Categorical encoding: Some categorical variables may need to be one-hot or label encoded for modeling.

This dataset is ideal for binary classification problems (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting,
or neural networks) and can also be used to experiment with feature engineering, imputation, and temporal models.
