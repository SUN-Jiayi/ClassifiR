\title{Predict Probabilities for Multiple Observations Using Decision Tree}
\usage{
predict_tree_prob_batch(tree, X)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{A trained decision tree.}

\item{X}{A feature data.frame.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of predicted probabilities.
}
\description{
Predicts the probability of the positive class (y = 1) for each sample in a dataset,
by traversing a trained decision tree. Applies \code{predict_tree_prob} to each observation in the input data.
}
\examples{
# Create toy data
X = data.frame(
  x1 = c(2, 5, 4, 3, 7, 2),
  x2 = c(1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2)
)
y = c(0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0)

# Train a decision tree
tree = build_tree(X, y, max_depth = 2, min_samples_split = 2)

# Predict probabilities for all samples
probs = predict_tree_prob_batch(tree, X)
print(probs)
