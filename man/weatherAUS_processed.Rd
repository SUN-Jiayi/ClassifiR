\description{
This dataset contains meteorological observations from various weather stations
in Australia. The data has been extensively processed to remove missing values,
convert categorical variables into numeric representations (via one-hot encoding),
and extract meaningful time-based features from date information. It includes 92
columns and 56,420 observations, with the final column being the target label.

\details{
A fully cleaned and preprocessed weather dataset derived from the original
Australian Bureau of Meteorology records. This dataset is tailored for
binary classification tasks, particularly for predicting whether it will
rain the next day (`RainTomorrow`). All preprocessing steps have been performed
in advance to ensure the dataset is machine-learning ready.


The dataset was prepared through the following steps:
\itemize{
  \item The original `Date` column was decomposed into three numerical variables: `Year`, `Month`, and `Day`, enabling time-aware modeling.
  \item Categorical variables such as `Location`, `WindGustDir`, `WindDir9am`, `WindDir3pm`, and `RainToday` were transformed using one-hot encoding.
        One level from each category was dropped to avoid multicollinearity due to the dummy variable trap.
  \item Numerical variables (e.g., temperatures, wind speed, humidity, pressure, cloud cover) were retained as-is.
  \item All rows containing missing values in any column were removed.
  \item The target variable `RainTomorrow` was kept as a binary categorical variable ("Yes", "No").
}

The dataset contains no missing values and no non-numeric predictors. All categorical variables were converted into a set of binary dummy variables.
This makes the dataset directly usable for most machine learning algorithms without additional preprocessing.
